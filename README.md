### Product Backlog
https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kg1b1Ck=/

### Order of Product Backlog rationale
We pretended as if we could only complete one story from the backlog and decided which story that would be. We continued this process with the rest of the stories in the backlog until the backlog was fully sorted and ordered. During this process we considered the value each story would bring to the stakeholders as well as dependencies between stories.

### Definition of Ready
For each PBI it must have:

- A size estimate

- Summary of work to be done

- Acceptance criteria

- Prerequisites defined and completed

- A title

### Relative-size Estimating
We used Affinity Group Sizing to estimate the size of the stories and pointed them using the number sequence provided in the Miro Planning Poker tool.
Everyone in the Strawberry team is a development team member so we were all involved in estimating. 

## First Sprint
Details of First Sprint can be found in PREVIOUSREADME.md file

## Second Sprint
Details of Second Sprint can be found in PREVIOUSREADME.md file

## Third Sprint

### Sprint Planning (1 point)
The forecast for the third sprint is 19 story points.

### Forecast Rationale (1 point)
We forecasted 19 story points because:
The team felt confident that they would be able to complete this number.  Another consideration was that there was at least one story that was carried over from the previous sprint, which was almost completed.

### Product Backlog
https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kg1b1Ck=/

### Order of Product Backlog rationale
We identified the smallest and largest product backlog items in terms of work effort. We then compared the level of effort required for the other items to these two items and ranked them. We then went over the list and reranked if there were any dependencies that would require an item to be completed prior to another. 

### Definition of Ready
For each PBI it must have:

- A size estimate

- Summary of work to be done

- Acceptance criteria

- Prerequisites defined and completed

- A title

### Relative-size Estimating
We used Affinity Group Sizing to estimate the size of the stories and pointed them using the number sequence provided in the Miro Planning Poker tool
All team members are development team members so the entire team was involved in estimating.

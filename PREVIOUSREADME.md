## Second Sprint

### Sprint Planning (1 point)
The forecast for the second sprint is 20 story points.

- Receipt metadata (3 points)

- Sort by date/amount/store name (1 point)

- Delete receipts (3 points)

- UI prototype (13 points)

### Forecast Rationale (1 point)
The forecast was an increase from the previous sprint because of a few reasons.  First, we were able to finish the initial setup of the project quicker than our expectation, which allowed us to start thinking about the code and how we are going to accomplish the user stories.  Second, team members were able to complete high story points in a short amount of time during the first sprint.  Thus, at the second Sprint Planning session, the team felt confident that they would be able to achieve higher story points in this second sprint.

### Sprint Planning Event (4 points)
On Sunday, Nov 15, the Development Team met and participated in the Sprint Planning event.  
1. We pulled stories from the Product Backlog into the Sprint Backlog. This is visible in Miro board where we’ve differentiated between the 2 backlogs using a deck card as a separator.  
2. The stories that were pulled to the Sprint backlog were representative of the Sprint Review Next Steps slide as seen in the screenshot below.  These stories were aligned with our stakeholders requests.  
3. The aggregate size of the stories is 20 points, which is equivalent to our forecast this sprint.  
4. Only Development Team members participated in this activity.  As evident in the log of Miro board below, during the time of this event, several members of the Development Team were active on Miro board.

 ### Backlog Size (1 point)
 Each backlog item is less than half of the sprint's forecast.  The smallest item is 1 story point, and the biggest item is 7 story points.

 ### User Story Decomposition (2 points)
 We decided to use <span style="color:purple">*a purple card*</span> to represent a Story and <span style="color:blue">*a blue card*</span> to represent a Dev Task.  Additionally, Dev Task is prefixed with the word "Dev Task".  Using this color rule, we can easily identify tasks from stories.  A Story may have more than 1 Dev Task.  Here are some examples of a Story and some Dev Task underneath it.

 ### Sprint Backlog Format and Accessibility (3 points)
 1. Our Sprint Backlog is represented in a Kanban board in Miro.
 2. The URL to Miro is: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kg1b1Ck=/
 3. Richard helped set the board and by virtue of access should be able to view the URL above.
 
 ### Sprint Burndown Chart (6 points)
 1. We have a Sprint Burndown Chart located above the image of a Strawberry on our Miro board: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kg1b1Ck=/
 2. The x-axis represents dates of the sprint by day.
 3. The y-axis represents story points remaining to be done.
 4. We tried our best to keep a linear curve descending from left to right, however, in the middle of the Sprint, we realized that we did not incorporate CI/CD User Stories to the Sprint as required by the grading rubric.  This is why you will see a spike in the chart about at around mid-sprint.
 5. The URL to the burndown chart is: https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kg1b1Ck=/
 6. Richard helped set the board and by virtue of access should be able to view the URL above.
 
 ### Daily Scrum (1 point)
 On Nov 24, the Development Team conducted a Daily Scrum as shown below:

There was one impediment that was brought up at the 11/24 Standup:
- Davey: Yes, I did encounter an impediment. My impediment was a critical failure of a backup restoration process after my laptop returned from the repair shop. It caused data loss, irreversibly, to my great dismay. My plan was simply to reinstall lost programs and let go of the data that was lost, which I did.

### Update Sprint Task Board and Burndown Chart (2 points)
Different members updated the Kanban board on different days as they progress with the assigned stories as seen in the log below:

#### What did you do?
##### 11/6

Diah - I shared this Google Document with the rest of the team members.  I created a recurrence meeting on Zoom to host Daily Scrum meetings moving forward.  I started a HTML and CSS file for the simple UI story to upload pictures..

Remi - set up MongoDB instance and provided team members with access to it

Rick - provided Remi with IP address and asked Richard questions about tracking development tasks.

William - worked on configuring MondoDB

Davey - worked on configuring MongoDB instance to our Meteor backend 

##### 11/9

The team today talked about when and who should move completed stories to the Done column.  As a team, we agreed that each assignee should be the one to do that.

Diah - Since our last meeting, I tested the connection to MongoDB.  I plan to confirm with other members of the team about our stories to make sure we’re not duplicating any work.  Then, I plan to continue to work on my story.  I had a blocker about cloning the repo and this blocker was addressed during the daily scrum today.

Remi - Got confirmation of database access - completing story for database configuration. Started researching OCR for next sprint.

Rick - confirmed DB access, reviewed Davey’s PRs, got set up with project, updated README with HW prompts, replaced sample code with receipt upload code

William - Got node, meteor, and webstorm installed. Repository cloned into git. Trying to run project

Davey - Implemented user authentication and got the code reviewed/merged. 

#### What will you do next?
##### 11/6
Diah - will create a simple picture upload page

Remi - will work on the functionality to extract data from receipts

Rick - will work on writing the backend functionality for uploading images

William - will work on implementing the data table for displaying picture upload information  

Davey - will work on implementing user authentication

##### 11/9
Diah - will work on ui for receipt upload

Remi - will work on functionality to extract data from receipts

Rick - complete receipt upload backend functionality, keep adding to README 

William - will work on implementing the data table for displaying picture upload information 

Davey - User auth is now implemented and seems to be working fine. We may want to write our own UI for the forms after we develop the app’s final UI presentation.

#### Impediments
We did not see any impediments that would keep us from meeting the Sprint Goal. We did not develop an impediment removal plan since we did not log any impediments. 

#### Activity
Evidence of us updating our task board

#### Mob or Paired Programming
Diah and I paired to finish up the UI portion of a story that I wrote the backend for. I navigated her around my code
she filled in the gaps to complete the story. Below is the conversation related to the scheduling of this meeting and 
the code that was written as a result.

#### Sprint Review
https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kg1b1Ck=/?moveToWidget=3074457351603556576&cot=14

Our stakeholder Tressa Jamil attended as evidenced by the Zoom participant list. She wanted a few features for the next sprint:

1. Centralized place to view all receipts

2. Ability to categorize receipts upon uploads.

The current product backlog already covers the first request, and we added the second request as a new product backlog item.
